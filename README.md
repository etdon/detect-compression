## ðŸ”° Introduction

The `detect-compression` project is a simple and easy to use script for detecting the compression algorithm used for the provided input.
It is powered by magic value analysis that allows the script to detect over 20 (including sub-types) popular compression algorithms.
While relying purely on magic value analysis of the header for compression algorithm detection is generally speaking not fully dependable
the system is processing in a most-to-least confident order and will provide meaningful results in common scenarios.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Requirements:
> - Python 3

To download the script click on the green `Code` button and select `Download ZIP`. After unpacking the downloaded `.zip` archive you
will be able to run the script by executing the following command:
```
python detect_compression.py <input>
```
The `input` parameter can either be a path to a file or a hex value. If a file path is provided the script will read the first 8 bytes of it and treat it as the input magic value for analysis.
